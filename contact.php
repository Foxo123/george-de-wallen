ABOUT US

Our story began in 1969 when the Founder of George Restaurants & Co. had an idea for amazing food served with a smile.
He was tired of going to restaurants that didn't acknowledge him. So he set out to create one with top-notch service for anyone.
In 1973, he had already set up 13 restaurants under this motto and it was a big success! 6 years later he had published 
this formula for franchise-owners alike. Hence our story began in de Wallen in 1989 and we have been serving happy customers ever since.

OUR MISSION

We strive towards excellence in food and service, to create the fond memories our customers treasure. 
Share a celebration or anniversary with your family, friends, and loved ones.
Our chefs are some of the best on the market and we make sure to price our products competitively. As George has intended it to.
Our patented formula makes for a great night out, no matter the circumstance!



From that local neighbourhood spot where everybody knows your name to a light-filled, eclectic restaurant with view
 on the Amstel river: George has it all.

Serving you iconic dishes and timeless classics with New York, Paris, the Côte d'Azur and Hong Kong in mind,
 along with local ingredients, freshly roasted coffee and signature cocktails, our restaurants are open all day,
  every day –  so come join us for an early morning espresso, a lazy Sunday brunch or an intimate dinner with friends
   in a relaxed, elegant atmosphere.

A FEAST FOR YOUR SENSES
Most of our restaurants are designed by Amsterdam based Architecture & Design studio Framework, 
who signed for our bespoke interiors and sophisticated yet intimate ambiance,
featuring typical George elements like metro tiles, lush leather couches, brass lighting, and marble bars.
With each location having its own charm, your visit to George quite literally is a feast for your eyes and taste buds.

Most of our locations have stunning, sunny terraces and are open all day, every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
